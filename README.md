The "Am I Cooked?" Expense Tracker

For people who are tired of being surprised by their bank account.

Welcome to the most honest expense tracker you'll ever use. This Python script doesn't just track your spending; it actively judges your life choices while storing your financial trauma in a file called my_money_goes_brrr.csv.

Features

Receipt Tracking: Loads your history of bad decisions every time you start the app.

"Oof Another One" Logging: Quickly add new expenses when you inevitably spend money you shouldn't have.

The Cold Hard Truth: A summary feature that shows you exactly where your money is going (spoiler: it's probably food).

Visual Guilt: ASCII bar charts show the percentage breakdown of your spending categories.

Persistent Trauma: Automatically saves everything to CSV so you can't escape your financial history even if you close the app.

How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Download the script.

Run it in your terminal:

python expense_tracker.py


Menu Options

When you launch the tracker, you'll be greeted by your broke homie and given 4 choices:

Just spent money (again): Log a new L. You'll need the Date, Amount, Category, and a Description ("spill the tea").

Show me the receipts: A chronological list of every time you messed up.

How cooked am i: The analytics dashboard. Shows total spent and a breakdown by category.

Save and run away: Saves your data to my_money_goes_brrr.csv and exits before you cry.

Data Storage

All data is stored in my_money_goes_brrr.csv. You can open this in Excel if you really want to see your Ls in high definition.

No cap, start saving money.
